Welcome to qWeyl, a Mathematica package designed to simulate quantum systems and information theory tasks pertaining to them. I developed this throughout my Master's degree in Pure Mathematics at Carleton University. It has been a major aid to my research, and I hope it can be to yours, too. The first thing you need to know is how to use Mathematica; linked below is the "get started" guide that I used to, well, get started. Next is that this package extends one called "qmatrix" by Timo Felbinger; this package is, in my humble opinion, very well put together, but a little outdated, having been last revised in 2001. Most, if not all, functions still work, but some run with warnings that I haven't had the time to fix. You will also need to download this package to use mine; it is linked below. It includes a well-written tutorial of itself, which is how I learned to use it, and I refer you first to this package. It wraps up all quantum objects, including state vectors, density objects, and operators, into a "matrix" object, which encodes the system that the object lives or acts on. In this way, one can use the noncommutative product ** and Mathematica will automatically pick the correct operation, whether it be tensor product, matrix product, inner product, etc. 

There is currently no tutorial for this package, and documentation is very limited also. Remember that I am a mathematician, not a software developer. I have tried my best to preserve the functional programming paradigm that Mathematica is designed around, but sometimes I have found myself using a for loop or an if/else if I can't figure out how to get around it. My thesis, "Gaussian Quantum States in Discrete Phase Space," will include partial documentation of this package, as well as an explanation of the mathematics (and indeed, some of the physics) involved. When it is finished, I will upload it either here or on my website, which also doesn't exist yet. 

My hope is that other researchers in the field find the package and continue to develop it, because I will not be able to. I will always be open to answering questions about it, though. If you are a graduate student in quantum information theory, learning to code and using a software package such as this one is a valuable way to complement your theoretical work; for example, I have been able to experiment with different ideas, notice patterns, then prove they are true, which I would have had a lot of trouble finding in the first place if I didn't have such a powerful sandbox to explore.
